# Documentation

A list of user documentation components (such as user manuals, online help, and tutorials) that will be provided alongside the software to be delivered. The documentation for the Deka Container Registry product will be available [here](https://docs.cloudeka.ai/deka-gpu/deka-gpu-registry) and will include guides on how to create, edit, view, and delete registries, along with detailed instructions on pushing, pulling, and managing container images via CLI and programmatic interfaces.
